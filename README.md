# Data Preparation Notebooks

Each dataset - a cohort study or a clinical trial - has numerous data fields. In studies where external validation using an independent dataset is desired. we often prepare a subset of the independent dataset that is "similar" to the original study dataset

> E.g: For an analyses done on Expedition-3, ADNI can be used as an independent dataset to validate the models. But the population charcteristics of EXPEDITION3 study are very specific - mild to moderate dementia, absence of depression etc. We need to identify similar subset in ADNI (MMSE<26, GDS<6, AB+ in PET or CSF) to validate the model performances.
